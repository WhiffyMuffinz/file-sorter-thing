File sorter script. Will take files from the "from" directory, and move them to the "to" directory, making subdirectories with the name of the file extension.
It will also prompt the user if they would like to delete files wiht particular extensions. 
There is also an example of how files with specific extensions can be sent to different directories, with the stuff referencing beat saber.


Something important I forgot was that the core code of the program is from here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-sort-and-store-files-with-same-extension/
