File sorter script. Will take files from the "from" directory, and move them to the "to" directory, making subdirectories with the name of the file extension.
It will also prompt the user if they would like to delete files with particular user-defined extensions.

The core code of the program is from here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-sort-and-store-files-with-same-extension/
